# WebSocket Messaging System

## Server Application (Port 8080)
A Spring Boot WebSocket server implementing STOMP protocol that:
- Receives messages at `/app/hello` endpoint
- Broadcasts greetings to `/topic/greetings` subscribers
- Uses model classes (`HelloMessage`, `Greeting`) for structured messaging
- Implements XSS protection via HTML escaping
- Configurable through application.yml (endpoints, prefixes)

## Client Application (Port 8081)
A Spring Boot STOMP client that:
- Auto-connects to server at startup
- Subscribes to `/topic/greetings`
- Handles incoming messages using `StompSessionHandler`
- Features automatic reconnection on failure
- Matches server's `Greeting` model for seamless deserialization
- Configurable connection parameters via application.yml

The system demonstrates a complete WebSocket-based communication solution with Spring's STOMP support, showing both server implementation and programmatic client connection. The client can receive real-time broadcasts from the server while maintaining resilience through connection recovery mechanisms.
